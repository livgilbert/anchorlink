# Anchorlink

Super basic. Install, then click the "Copy link to here" button in the right-click menu to copy a link to the page that includes an anchor to the closest element one could reasonably consider to be an anchor.

Tested on Firefox for about 10 minutes before pushing. There will be bugs but if anyone wants to be cool and make this code actually good that'd go hard.
